# CagOS - x86 Operating System

A minimal x86 (i386) operating system with **inode-based file system** and **persistent disk storage**.

## Features

- âœ… 32-bit protected mode
- âœ… GRUB bootloader (Multiboot)
- âœ… VGA text mode output
- âœ… IDE disk driver with LBA addressing
- âœ… SimpleFS - Inode-based file system
- âœ… **Persistent storage** - Files survive reboot!
- âœ… Interactive shell with file management
- âœ… Keyboard input support
- âœ… ~800 lines of clean C code

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Clang with 32-bit support
- LLD linker
- QEMU (qemu-system-i386)
- GRUB tools (grub-mkrescue)
- WSL or Linux environment

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install clang lld qemu-system-x86 llvm \
    grub-pc-bin grub-common xorriso mtools
```

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build
make

# Run (serial console only)
make run

# Run with window (VGA output)
make run-window
```

## Usage

### Shell Commands

```
help            - Show all commands
ls              - List all files with inode numbers
cat <file>      - Display file contents
create <file>   - Create new empty file
write <file>    - Write content to file (multi-line)
rm <file>       - Delete file
format          - Format filesystem (erases all data!)
hello           - Print greeting
exit            - Exit shell
```

### Example Session

```bash
> create hello.txt
File 'hello.txt' created successfully

> write hello.txt
Enter content (end with empty line):
| Hello from SimpleFS!
| This data persists across reboots!
| 
Wrote 59 bytes to 'hello.txt'

> ls
Files:
  [0] hello.txt (59 bytes)
Total: 1 files

> cat hello.txt
Hello from SimpleFS!
This data persists across reboots!

# Restart the system...
> ls
Files:
  [0] hello.txt (59 bytes)
Total: 1 files

# File is still there! âœ…
```

## Architecture

### File System (SimpleFS)

- **Inode-based**: Each file has metadata (inode)
- **Persistent**: Data written to real IDE disk
- **Layout**:
  - Sector 0: Superblock (filesystem metadata)
  - Sectors 1-10: Inode table (64 inodes)
  - Sectors 11+: Data blocks (file contents)

**Specifications:**
- Max files: 64
- Max file size: 2 KB (4 blocks Ã— 512 bytes)
- Disk size: 2 MB (4096 sectors)
- Block size: 512 bytes

### Components

- **Kernel** (`src/kernel/`)
  - Boot process & main kernel
  - Memory management
  - Interrupt handling
  - Common utilities

- **Drivers** (`src/drivers/`)
  - VGA text mode driver
  - IDE/ATA disk driver
  - PS/2 keyboard driver

- **File System** (`src/fs/`)
  - SimpleFS implementation
  - Inode management
  - Block allocation

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C11 + x86 Assembly
- **Bootloader**: GRUB (Multiboot specification)
- **Memory**: Identity-mapped, no paging
- **I/O**: Port-mapped I/O for all devices
- **Disk**: IDE (ATA) with 28-bit LBA
- **Interrupts**: PIC (8259) for IRQ handling

## Educational Value

Perfect for learning:
- x86 boot process with GRUB
- VGA text mode programming
- IDE/ATA disk driver implementation
- Inode-based file systems from scratch
- Persistent storage on real hardware
- Sector-based disk I/O
- OS fundamentals without over-complexity

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clean previous builds
make clean

# Build bootable ISO
make

# The output is os.iso which can be run with:
# - QEMU: make run
# - VirtualBox: Mount os.iso as CD-ROM
# - Real hardware: Burn to CD and boot!
```

## Performance

- Boot time: ~2 seconds
- File operations: Near instant
- Disk I/O: Direct IDE hardware access

Educational x86 operating system with real disk I/O! ðŸš€

There are some problems. 
    I can't write first file i created. But other files okay for sure.
    Pagination and page table implementation does exist but not used yet.
    VirtualBox Version doesn't work, it just loops even though there are no keyboard input.
